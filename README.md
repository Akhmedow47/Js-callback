# Callbacks in JavaScript

In JavaScript, a **callback** is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the other function has finished executing. Callbacks are commonly used to handle asynchronous operations such as reading files, handling events, or working with APIs.

## Simple Callback Example

A basic example of how callbacks work:

```javascript
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
  callback(); // Call the callback function
}

function afterGreet() {
  console.log("Greeting complete!");
}

greet("John", afterGreet);
```
## Explanation:

*setTimeout is an asynchronous function that takes a callback and executes it after a specified delay (in this case, 2 seconds).
Even though there is a delay, the program continues running synchronously, so "End" is logged before the callback executes.
Output:*

Start
End
Executed after 2 seconds
Why Use Callbacks?

Handling Asynchronous Code: Callbacks allow you to execute functions after time-consuming operations, like API requests or file reading, without blocking the execution of other code.
Event Handling: Callbacks are commonly used in event-driven programming to respond to events such as user clicks, form submissions, etc.
Summary

A callback is a function passed to another function and executed later.
Callbacks are commonly used in asynchronous programming, such as handling events or making API calls.
They help ensure code execution order, especially in non-blocking scenarios.
For more advanced use cases, you can explore Promises and async/await, which are designed to handle asynchronous operations more cleanly than using nested callbacks.
